            <p class="sectionSubtag text-small">Education in India is a complex and diverse system that plays a crucial
                role in shaping the country's future. With a population of over 1.3 billion people, India faces
                significant challenges in providing quality education to all its citizens. The education system in India
                is divided into different levels, including primary, secondary, and tertiary education.</p>
            <p class="sectionSubtag text-small">
                In recent years, there has been a push towards skill development and vocational education to bridge the
                gap between education and employability. The government has launched initiatives such as Skill India and
                National Skills Qualifications Framework (NSQF) to promote skill-based training and entrepreneurship.
            </p>
            <p class="sectionSubtag text-small">
                Overall, while India has made progress in expanding access to education, there are still significant
                challenges to overcome. Continued efforts to address infrastructure gaps, improve the quality of
                teaching, and foster innovation in the education sector are crucial for India to harness its demographic
                dividend and ensure a brighter future for its citizens.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubtag text-small">Transforming education in India is an urgent and essential task for the
                country's progress and development. Recognizing the need for change, several initiatives and reforms
                have been introduced to address the existing challenges and improve the quality of education.</p>
            <p class="sectionSubtag text-small">
                One key focus of the transformation efforts is to shift from a rote-learning and exam-centric approach
                to a more holistic and learner-centered education system. The emphasis is now on encouraging critical
                thinking, problem-solving skills, creativity, and innovation. This shift aims to equip students with the
                necessary skills to succeed in the rapidly evolving global landscape.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubtag text-small">Overall, the transformation of education in India is a multi-faceted
                endeavor that encompasses curriculum reforms, technological integration, skill development,
                infrastructure improvement, and inclusive practices. It requires collaborative efforts from the
                government, educational institutions, teachers, parents, and the wider community. By embracing these
                changes and investing in education, India can empower its youth, foster innovation and entrepreneurship,
                and pave the way for a brighter future.</p>
